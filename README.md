# CSCI-1300_Project1
This was the project for my Introduction to Computing Class at the University of Colorado Boulder.

The project involved implementing functions in order to encrypt/decrypt a message by iterating through the string that the user wished to encrypt or decrypt and using a specific right shift using the ASCII value of each character.
